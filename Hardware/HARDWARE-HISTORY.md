# 🛠️ Hardware History & Evolution

This file documents every major hardware component that has ever passed through the homelab, what the machine *started with*, what was *upgraded*, and what is *planned* for the future.

## 🔄 Upgrades

### **Motherboard**
- **Before:** H110  (forgot the exact model)
- **After:** MSI H310  
- **Reason:** Compatibility with newer cpus + general reliability improvements.

### **CPU**
- **Before:** Intel i3 (7th gen, also forgot the exact model)  
- **After:** Intel i5-8600  
- **Reason:** I expect a healthy sized jump in performance for virtualization, containers, and basically anything cpu bound.

### **Cooling System**
- **Original:** Basic stock fan (was CRAZY dusty)  
- **Upgrade #1:** Arctic Freezer Xtreme  
- **Upgrade #2:** *Incoming* — AIO Liquid Cooler (forgot the exact model occurance #3 (i'll edit all these when i get home and take a look at everything again))

## ➕ Added Hardware

### **RAM**
- +4GB DDR4 stick → total **8GB DDR4**  
- Humble but should be enough for lightweight VMs and testing environments.

### **GPU / Compute Accelerator**
- **Added:** NVIDIA Tesla K40  
- **Purpose:** CUDA, LLMs, compute tasks, experimentation.

## 📌 Planned Improvements

The current setup is essentially **a 2010–2013 era homelab revived from ewaste**. I expect it to work well for lightweight tasks, but my long term goals include:

- More RAM (16GB -> 32GB minimum)
- Newer CPU + board combo eventually  
- Dedicated NAS machine  
- Better airflow or case redesign  
- Proper UPS  
- Upgrading storage to NVMe if supported  
- Stronger GPU or compute card  
- Aiming to eventually build a calm late 2010s setup

## 📦 Purpose of This Document
This file exists so the repo always has a clear record of:
- What hardware has been used  
- What has changed over time  
- What the future roadmap looks like  
- How the homelab grew from an old crusty unused pc to a nice useful server at the very least
