## 📌 Planned Improvements

The current setup is essentially **a 2010–2013 era homelab revived from ewaste**. I expect it to work well for lightweight tasks, but my long term goals include:

- More RAM (16GB -> 32GB minimum)
- Newer CPU + board combo eventually  
- Dedicated NAS machine  
- Better airflow or case redesign
- Stronger GPU or compute card
- Better PSU 
- Aiming to eventually build a calm late 2010s - early 2020s setup

## 📦 Purpose of This Document
This file exists so the repo always has a clear record of:
- What hardware has been used  
- What has changed over time  
- What the future roadmap looks like  
- How the homelab grew from an old crusty unused pc to a nice useful server at the very least
